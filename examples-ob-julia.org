#+TITLE: Examples of code blocks with ob-julia

* IN-PROGRESS External evaluation
If ~:session~ is not specified (or equal to ~none~), then the code block is evaluated through an external process.

** IN-PROGRESS With ~:results output~
Simple (numeric or text) ~:results output~ are supported:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :exports both
println("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world!

#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both
print(2+3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5

More complex outputs such as graphic files are still to be supported.

** IN-PROGRESS With ~:results value~
This is only supported with basic Julia types to date. Non-native data structures, such as DataFrames, are not supported yet.

*** DONE Arrays
    CLOSED: [2020-10-06 mar. 18:32]
#+begin_src julia :results value
a = [1 2 3 4]
a
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

*** DONE Dictionaries
    CLOSED: [2020-10-06 mar. 18:33]
#+begin_src julia :results value
d = Dict("Emacs" => "awesome", "Julia" => "nice")
d
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| Julia | nice    |
| Emacs | awesome |

*** DONE Tuples
    CLOSED: [2020-10-06 mar. 18:35]
#+begin_src julia :results value
t = ("org", "mode", "is", "great")
t
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| org   |
| mode  |
| is    |
| great |

* TODO Evaluation within a session
Evaluation of several code blocks within a given session is not supported yet.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :session *juliasession* :exports both
println("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: You want to use session *juliasession* but this does not work yet :-)
