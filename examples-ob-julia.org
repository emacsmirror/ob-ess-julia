#+TITLE: Examples of code blocks with ob-julia
#+AUTHOR: Frédéric Santos

* IN-PROGRESS External evaluation
If ~:session~ is not specified (or equal to ~none~), then the code block is evaluated through an external process:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :exports both
println("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world!

* TODO Evaluation within a session
Evaluation of several code blocks within a given session is not supported yet.
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results output :session *juliasession* :exports both
println("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: You want to use session *juliasession* but this does not work yet :-)
