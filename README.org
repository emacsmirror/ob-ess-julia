* Introduction
~ob-ess-julia~ intends to offer a lightweight support for Julia language into Org mode. This is still an incomplete implementation to date, roughly in an alpha stage.

** Why ~ob-ess-julia~ instead of ~ob-julia~?
Julia has several backends within Emacs: [[https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl][julia-repl]], [[https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail][julia-snail]], and [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS][ess-julia]]. Furthermore, Julia can also be used through Jupyter using [[https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook#ob-ein][ob-ein]] or [[https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-jupyter#org-mode-source-blocks][emacs-jupyter]]. The present package is based on [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS][ESS]], but it would be unfair to "preempt" the name ~ob-julia~, since using ESS is only one solution among other ones, and cannot be regarded as the canonical solution.

~ob-ess-julia~ is basically a fork of [[https://github.com/gjkerns/ob-julia][the good old ob-julia]], which is now orphaned. It has also several other forks, and I did not want any confusion among those packages. As a consequence, the general form of src blocks in ~ob-ess-julia~ is:

=#+begin_src ess-julia=

=#+end_src=

** Implemented features and TODOs [57%]
   - [X] External evaluation with verbatim output (~:results output~)
   - [X] External evaluation with well-formatted output (~:results value~), for standard Julia data structures and DataFrames
   - [X] Session evaluation (using inferior ESS processes) with ~:session~ header argument
   - [X] Inline graphical outputs
   - [X] Ability to indicate ~:width~ and ~:height~ of graphical outputs in pixels
   - [X] Displaying output as org tables with ~:results value~ in session evaluation, with or without headers
   - [X] Make ~ob-ess-julia~ compatible with polymode so that ~ess-julia-mode~ can be used as innermode in the src blocks
   - [X] Handling variables passed with ~:var~ header argument
   - [ ] Handling ~:dir~ header argument to set working directory of ~ess-julia~ session (works, but with a glitch)
   - [ ] Allow for more Julia types to be displayed with ~:results value~ (only arrays, dataframes, dictionaries and tuples are supported to date; other types might work as well but have not be tested yet)
   - [ ] Better error management
   - [ ] Improve documentation
   - [ ] Implement some simple unit tests
   - [ ] (Maybe, one day,) host this package on MELPA if it reaches a sufficient quality

** Alternatives for using Julia in Org mode
- Another fork of the original ~ob-julia~ [[https://git.nixo.xyz/nixo/ob-julia][is available online]]. It offers advanced options such as async evaluation.
- Using a Jupyter Julia kernel from within Emacs is also possible.

* How to use ~ob-ess-julia~
** Installation and settings
This package can be installed from MELPA. For instance, if you have [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][~use-package~]] installed, simply add the following lines to your Emacs initialisation file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output
;; Load ob-ess-julia and dependencies
(use-package ob-ess-julia
  :ensure t
  :config
  ;; Add ess-julia into supported languages:
  (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages
                               (append org-babel-load-languages
                                       '((ess-julia . t))))
  ;; Link this language to ess-julia-mode (although it should be done by default):
  (setq org-src-lang-modes
        (append org-src-lang-modes '(("ess-julia" . ess-julia)))))
#+end_src

** Demo
Some examples of implemented features can be found in the file ~examples-ob-ess-julia.org~.

** Notes and tips
- ~:session~ names should be prefixed an suffixed by ~*~, e.g. ~*julia*~ or ~*mysession*~ are convenient names.
- The following Julia packages are required: ~CSV~, ~DelimitedFiles~, ~Pipe~. They are used for the ~:result value~ output type. They are loaded (with ~using~) at the beginning of each Julia session started with ~ob-ess-julia~ (which is inelegant; but I couldn't find a better option).
- I suggest the following settings for the Emacs initialisation file:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output
;; Shortcuts for Julia code block headers.
;; Shortcut for "normal" session evaluation with verbatim output:
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
	     '("j" . "src ess-julia :results output :session *julia* :exports both"))
;; Shortcut for inline graphical output within a session:
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
	     '("jfig" . "src ess-julia :results output graphics file :file FILENAME.png :session *julia* :exports both"))
;; Shortcut for well-formatted org table output within a session:
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
	     '("jtab" . "src ess-julia :results value table :session *julia* :exports both :colnames yes"))
  #+end_src
- ~ob-ess-julia~ works better with [[https://github.com/polymode/poly-org][polymode]] and [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company]]:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output
;; Add polymode:
(use-package poly-org
  :ensure t)
;; Add company:
(use-package company
  :ensure t)
;; Tweaks for company:
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
(setq company-global-modes '(not org-mode text-mode))
(setq ess-use-company 'script-only)
;; Add company quickhelp:
(use-package company-quickhelp
  :ensure t
  :config
  (company-quickhelp-mode))
  #+end_src
