#+TITLE: ob-julia, Julia support for Org mode
#+AUTHOR: Frédéric Santos

Following [[https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-within-org-mode-what-about-a-new-ob-julia/46308/9][my proposition on Julia discourse forum]], this repo intends to offer (maybe, one day...) a support for Julia language into Org mode. *This is still a very incomplete implementation to date.*

Other (much more advanced) forks of [[https://github.com/gjkerns/ob-julia][the good old ob-julia]] have been made available by various authors: [[https://git.nixo.xyz/nixo/ob-julia][an example here]]. Those forks are clearly the best (I should say, the /only/) solution for now.

* Progress status
The estimated progress is about 10 % :-)

Some examples of implemented features can be found in the file ~examples-ob-julia.org~.

* Disclaimer
My current knowledge of both Julia and Elisp is very limited, so that the present repo is essentially a sandbox, and should absolutely not be considered for public use yet. Trying to make another fork of ~ob-julia~ is primarily a way of improving my knowledge in those two languages with a challenging project. However, all contributions are welcome.

* How to use ~ob-julia~
** Installation
This package is not (yet?) hosted on MELPA. Thus, simply download the whole Git repo somewhere on your hard drive, and add the following lines to your Emacs initialization file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output
(add-to-list 'load-path "/your/path/to/ob-julia/")
(require 'ob-julia)
#+end_src

** Notes
(This section is still to be expanded.)

- ~ob-julia~ is based on [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS][ESS]]. Thus, the Emacs package ~ess~ is required.
- ~:session~ names should be prefixed an suffixed by ~*~, e.g. ~*julia*~ or ~*mysession*~ are convenient names.
- The following Julia packages are required: ~CSV~, ~DelimitedFiles~. They are used for the ~:result value~ output type. They are loaded (with ~using~) at the beginning of each Julia session started with ~ob-julia~.

* License
This package is under a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeCILL][CeCILL 2.1 license]], which is compatible with GPL license.
