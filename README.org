#+TITLE: ob-julia, Julia support for Org mode
#+AUTHOR: Frédéric Santos

Following [[https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-within-org-mode-what-about-a-new-ob-julia/46308/9][my proposition on Julia discourse forum]], this repo intends to offer (maybe, one day...) a support for Julia language into Org mode. *This is still an incomplete implementation to date.*

Other (much more advanced) forks of [[https://github.com/gjkerns/ob-julia][the good old ob-julia]] have been made available by various authors: [[https://git.nixo.xyz/nixo/ob-julia][an example here]]. Those forks are clearly the best (I should say, the /only/) solution for now.

* Progress status
The estimated progress is about 1 % :-)

* Disclaimer
My current knowledge of both Julia and Elisp is very limited, so that the present repo is essentially a sandbox, and should absolutely not be considered for public use yet. Trying to make another fork of ~ob-julia~ is primarily a way of improving my knowledge in those two languages with a challenging project. However, all contributions are welcome.

* Documentation
- ~:session~ names should be prefixed an suffixed by ~*~, e.g. ~*julia*~ or ~*mysession*~ are convenient names.
